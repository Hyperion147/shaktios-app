# Minimal Template

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com).

It was initialized using the following command, then the `Minimal (Nativewind)` template was selected when prompted:

```bash
npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest init
```

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
```

This will start the Expo Dev Server. Open the app in:

- **iOS**: press `i` to launch in the iOS simulator _(Mac only)_
- **Android**: press `a` to launch in the Android emulator
- **Web**: press `w` to run in a browser

You can also scan the QR code using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your device. This project fully supports running in Expo Go for quick testing on physical devices.

## Configuration (ShaktiOS citizen app)

Copy the example env file and fill in your values (`.env` is gitignored, never commit it):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` | FastAPI backend base URL (default `http://localhost:8000`). For a physical phone on the same Wi-Fi, use `http://<LAN_IP>:8000` with the backend listening on `0.0.0.0`. Restart `dev` after changing it. |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL (Auth only). |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase publishable key (safe for clients). Never use a service-role key here. |

The app submits citizen reports to `POST {API_URL}/events` with the Supabase JWT as `Authorization: Bearer`. The backend derives identity from the JWT; the client never sends user IDs.

## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [...components]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.
